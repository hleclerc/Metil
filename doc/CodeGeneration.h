\page CodeGeneration Code generation

    Code generation is a feature which aims at describing problems at the highest possible level so that:
        - (Genericity) Code can be ported to various platforms. For instance behaviors can be described using state and dissipation potentials, and computations ran on the platform or Abaqus UMAT can be created.
        - Optimizations are possible in term of operation scheduling and ressource management (swap...)
 
    Code generation is classical for finite element declaration, behavior description, image manipulations...
