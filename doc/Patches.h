\page Patches Patches and contributions

@section Documentation

The documentation is automatically generated using doxygen. To obtain the @p html pages generated from your version of the sources, simply type

\code
cd ...directory_metil_sources
make documentation
\endcode

@section Submitting Submitting a patch

The first thing to do is to locally commit the patch. You can for example use

\code
git commit -a
\endcode

If you have downloaded the sources from

\code
git clone git://...
\endcode

you will have to make a patch using git format-patch and send it to leclerc@lmt.ens-cachan.fr or pasquier@lmt.ens-cachan.fr

If you have downloaded the sources from

\code
git clone git@...
\endcode

because you have the read/write rights, simply type

\code
git push
\endcode
